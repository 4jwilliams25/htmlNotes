    <!-- img tags should all have src, alt, width, and height attributes -->
    <!-- alt tag is for screen readers, ok to leave it blank if not important but leaving it off will make the reader read off the img id -->
    <!-- Including the width and height att will keep the text from bouncing around as the img loads -->
    <img
      src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/05/us/05onfire1_xp/05onfire1_xp-jumbo-v2.jpg"

    <!-- 4 main file formats: GIF -->
    <!-- GIF is good at compressing large areas of a single color but limited colors; bad for photographs -->
    <!-- SVG good for logos, icons ect.; vector file; can scale well w/o losing quality, small file size; use if possible  -->
    <!-- JPG; good for compressing photos; make sure it's resized and compressed for web or site will be slow -->
    <!-- PNG; good for photos where some transparency is needed; SOMETIMES better compression results than JPG -->

    <h4>Responsive Images</h4>
    <!-- Make images smaller and more compressed for smaller devices and larger and higher quality for larger -->
    <!-- Different screens support different pixel density (1X, 2X, 3X, etc) -->
    <!-- Can make multiple copies of img of different size and res and include them all in srcset attribute; browser will decide which one to use -->
    <!-- sizes attribute can further change which photo is selected based on screensize -->
    <!-- srcset tells browser the res and width it has to choose from -->
    <!-- sizes tells the browser how much fo the screen width to take up with the img at different screen -->
    <img
      src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/940586530515504757/CDDE77CB810474E1C07B945E40AE4713141AFD76/"

    <h4>Responsive Pictures</h4>
    <!-- You can use different images alltogether for different screen sizes using the picture element -->
    <!-- Once you wrap the img in a picture element you can have more granular control through src element -->
    <!-- Can use multiple images and sizes attribute in the source elements too -->
    <!-- Using w instead of px tells the browser to consider src density and window width when picking the img source -->
    <picture>
      <source
        media="min-width:600px"
        srcset="
          https://sm.ign.com/t/ign_ap/screenshot/d/diablo-imm/diablo-immortals-classes_a25r.1080.jpg 600w

      <h4>Figure and Captions</h4>
      <!-- Adding captions in a figcapture element and wrapping it and the img in a figure element -->
      <!-- Tells browsers that the two pieces of data are linked -->
